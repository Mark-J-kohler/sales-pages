Membership<p>This Agreement is between the Member listed above and Kohler, authorizing the Member to participate in the MSTP© Program. The Member may not transfer their Membership to another individual or entity without the express written consent of Kohler. The Member further agrees not to share his or her login information or access to any aspect of the Program with other individuals or entities without the express written permission of Kohler.<p>B.

Certification Quizzes and Exams<p>(1) Each Section has a quiz consisting of 10-25 questions, and each Module has a Final exam of 25-50 questions. These tests must be completed and passed with a score of 90% or greater before Members gain access to the next Section’s training.<p><p>(2) Members are allowed to retake any test as many times as needed to obtain a passing score of 90%.<p>E. Access and time allowed to complete the MSTP© Certification<p>(1) If the Member stays active with the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training (set forth below) from the date of this Agreement, with no interruption in the Monthly Membership, the Member can take as long as Member needs to start and finish the Certification process.<p><p>Subsection (2) – (5) below only applies if the Member discontinues the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training.<p><p>(2) If however, the Member withdraws from the Monthly Membership Training and is no longer enrolled in that portion of the Program, the Member must begin the Certification process within six (6) months from that date, hereinafter referred to as “Beginning the Certification Process” and defined as a Member watching any portion of the first video in the Training Library- Module 1, Section 1.<p><p>(3) Once the Member begins the Certification Process, as defined above, the Member then has twelve (12) months from that date to complete the Certification portion of the Program. Thus, the Member essentially has a maximum of eighteen (18) months to finish the Certification portion of the Program from the date the Member discontinues participating and paying for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training.<p><p>(4) If the Member does not Begin the Certification Process within six (6) months of withdrawing from the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training, the Member forfeits the right to begin the Certification portion of the Program entirely and the Member is not due a Refund of the Purchase Price.<p><p>(5) If the Member does not finish the Certification within twelve (12) months after starting the Certification process, the Member forfeits the right to finish the Certification and is not due a refund of the Purchase Price and must re-pay for the MSTP© Certification Program. However, the Member is allowed to re-purchase the Certification at a discounted price within 12 months of forfeiting the right to finish the Certification for $2,500. The Member is not allowed to re-purchase the Certification a 2nd time at the discounted price. Thus, if the Member doesn’t finish the Certification portion of the Program under the same time constraints, Member forfeits their right to purchase the Program again at a discount.<p><p>Example 1.1 – If the Member purchases the Program on August 15th, 2023, continues to participate and continues to participate and pay for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training, without any gaps in payment, the Member has unlimited time to finish the Certification.<p><p>Example 1.2 – If the Member purchased the Program on December 15th, 2023, the Member has until June 15, 2024 to start the first video Module 1, Section 1, and then has another (12) months, or until June 15, 2025 to complete all of the training videos and exams in order to pass the Certification and become Certified.<p><p>Example 1.3 – If the Member purchased the Program on September 15th, 2023, but quits paying for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training on December 15th, 2023, the Member then has until June 15th, 2024 (6 months) to begin the first video Module 1, Section 1. If they watch the first Module 1, Section 1 video on June 1st, 2024, the Member then has until June 1, 2025 to complete all of the training videos and exams in order to pass the Certification portion of the Program and become Certified.<p><p>Example 1.4 – If the Member purchases the Program on December 2nd, 2023, and starts the program on May 1, 2024, but doesn’t finish the Certification Program within 12 months by May 1, 2025, the Member no longer has access to the Certification process, but may repurchase the Certification by May 1, 2026 for $2,500 (no matter what the current price of the MSTP© Certification is at the time). The Member’s re-purchase starts the timing process over again as if it was a new purchase. However, if the Member doesn’t finish the Certification the 2nd time around, within the maximum time of 18 months (assuming the Member starts Module 1, Section 1 exactly 6 months after purchasing the Program a 2nd time), the Member may then NOT re-purchase the Certification portion of the Program a 2nd time at the discounted price.<p>F. Re-Certification for MSCTA©<p>(1) If the Member is not yet Certified, they are not required to Re-Certify. The topics each year in the Re-Certification process will be integrated into the MSTP© Certification Program by January 1st of the upcoming year. Thus, the Member has access to the most current information and training at all times without having to “Re-Certify”.<p><p>(2) However, if the Member gets Certified at any time during the year before December 31st, they are required to go through the Re-Certification process in order to use the MSCTA© designation in the upcoming year and be listed on the MSTP Network©. (This is simply due to the annual tax updates and developments in the law that occur each year and the Re-Certification is truly for every Member’s benefit and education. The Re-Certification will also provide Continuing Education credits upon completion).<p><p>(3) Re-Certification shall take place for approximately ninety (90) days between January 1st and the end of March the beginning of each year. Members must watch the Re-Certification videos and complete the Re-Certification Exam by the end of March, with a score of 90% or more in order to be Certified for the next year and use the MSCTA© designation and be listed on the MSTP Network©. Members can take the Re-Certification Test as many times as necessary to pass with a score of 90%.<p>.<p>(4) The cost for Re-Certification is $1,500 unless the Certified Member meets one of the following exceptions:<p><p>They have maintained their MSTP© Monthly Membership Training without interruption since joining the MSTP© Program, OR<p>They have re-enrolled in the Monthly Membership Training since cancelling it, and have paid for at least five (5) months of the Monthly Membership Training dues during the preceding year.<p>Example 1.1 – The Member purchases the MSTP© Program in September of 2023 and got Certified at some point before December 31st. The Member has been consistently paying for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training since the Member purchased the MSTP© Program. The Member does not need to pay for the Re-Certification separately. It is included with their MSTP© Monthly Membership Training dues.<p><p>Example 1.2 – The Member purchases the MSTP© Program in August of 2023, and only paid for one month of the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training. Regardless of when the Member got Certified during the year, or the preceding year, the Member would be required to pay for the Re-Certification cost of $1,500.<p><p>Example 1.3 – The Member purchases the MSTP© Program in May of 2023, receives the 1st month’s Monthly Membership Training for free, and then pays for 5 months of Monthly Membership Training through October 2023. The Member gets Certified at some point before December 31st. The Member then decides in January to get Re-Certified. The Member at that point could re-enroll in the Monthly Membership Training, paying for their first month of the Monthly Membership Training in the new year, and be exempt from paying $1,500 because they paid for five (5) months of Monthly Membership Training in the Prior year.<p>G. MSTP© Monthly Membership Training<p>(1) The MSTP© Program also includes significant ongoing training and support for its Members with the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training. Kohler agrees to provide the following benefits in this Monthly Membership:<p><p>Includes annual Re-Certification videos and test at no additional cost 2 Weekly Live Technical Training sessions with Mark personally hosting most of these training sessions A Monthly Live Mindset Training session A Monthly Live Business Building training session One Complimentary General Admission in person ticket, or virtual ticket, to both semi-annual 3-day Tax and Legal 360 Conferences©, or $499 off VIP or Premium upgrades (See conditions below). Access to the MSTP© Member Forum and Facebook Group Public profile on the Tax Advisor Network, contingent on meeting required Tax Advisor Network profile standards (See below). Ongoing access to the Training Library, videos, whitepapers, etc.<p>(2) The 2023 cost for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training is $299 a month (a 30-day period based on the day of the month the Member enrolls). The first month is free when the Member purchases the MSTP© Program, and then the Member is charged 30 days later, in advance for the next upcoming 30-day period of Membership. The billing date for each Member coincides on the day the Member enrolled in the MSTP© Program.<p><p>(3) Kohler reserves the right to change the monthly prices of the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training as economic conditions may require.<p><p>(4) A Member must have an active credit card or ACH payment method on file in order to participate in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training.<p><p>Example 1.1 – A Member Joins the MSTP© Program on March 15th of 2024, and receives the 1st month’s Monthly Membership (30-day period) for free through April 15th, 2024. The Member is then billed on April 15th, 2024, for the next upcoming 30-day period, and on the 15th day of every month thereafter the Member is enrolled in the Monthly Membership.<p>H. Tax and Legal 360 Conference©<p>(1) Kohler agrees to hold two 3-day conferences a year known as the Tax and Legal 360 Conference©. Kohler may provide these at a location for Live in person attendance, or broadcast them Virtually as economic conditions may dictate.<p><p>(2) When a Member is enrolled in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training, and meet the conditions below, they will receive one complimentary virtual broadcast ticket, or a General Admission ticket to attend in person, to both semi-annual Tax and Legal 360 Conferences©. In 2023 the Member may choose to upgrade their General Admission ticket with a credit of $499 to the Premium ticket or VIP experience.<p><p>(3) Kohler reserves the right to change the amount of the credit a Member may have to upgrade their ticket as economic conditions may require.<p><p>(4) In order for a Member to receive this benefit of a free ticket or upgrade ,the Member must have:<p><p>Consistently been enrolled in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training interruption since joining the MSTP© Program, OR<p>Re-enrolled in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training and paid for at least three (3) consecutive months of the Monthly Membership preceding the month of the Tax and Legal 360 Conferences©<p>Example 1.1 – The Member Joins the MSTP© Program on April 15th of 2024, receives the 1st month’s Monthly Membership Training for free, and then stays enrolled and pays for May’s Membership on May 15th. As such, the Member shall receive one (1) complimentary ticket or credit for the June 3-day Tax and Legal 360 Conference©.<p><p>Example 1.2 – The Member joins the MSTP© Program on February 15th, 2024, and receives the 1st month’s Monthly Membership Training for free until March 15th. The Member then pays on March 15th for the next 30-day period of Membership thru April 15th, after which the Member then cancels their enrollment in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training. As such, the Member would not receive a complimentary ticket or credit for the June 3-day Tax and Legal 360 Conference©.<p><p>Example 1.3 – The Member Joins the MSTP© Program on December 15th, 2023, receives the 1st month’s Monthly Membership for free through January 15th, 2024. At this point however, the Member cancels their enrollment in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training in late January, but then on March 1st, 2024 the Member realizes the benefits they are missing out on and re-enrolls in the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training. The Member then pays on the following April 1st, and May 1st, for a total of 3 months of consecutive Membership. As such, since the Member has re-enrolled and paid for 3-months of the Monthly Membership before, the June 3-day Tax and Legal 360 Conference©, the Member will receive one (1) complimentary ticket or credit for the June 3-day Tax and Legal 360 Conference©.<p>I. MSTP Network©<p>(1) The MSTP Network©, is a page and service maintained by Kohler on the www.markjkohler.com website with a list of all the Certified Tax Pros that want to be included therein and participate in the “Tax Pro Network”. Visitors to the markjkohler website can use the MSTP Network© to find an MSCTA© and engage them for a variety of tax, legal, or financial services.<p><p>(2) Kohler does not take a fee for an MSCTA© obtaining a new client through the Tax Pro Network, nor does Kohler take a percentage of any revenue earned for services provided by the MSCTA© to a client obtained on the MSTP Network©.<p><p>(3) In order for a MSCTA© to participate and be listed on the MSTP Network© page, the Member must do all of the following:<p><p>be Certified under MSTP© Program in the current year, and/or the Member having maintained their Certification by Re-Certifying in the current year, AND currently be paying for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training and not past due, AND completed and have continued to maintain the Member Marketing Standards for the MSTP Network© regularly distributed and set-forth for the Members on the Resource Page of the MSTP© Membership Site. J. Continuing Education Credits<p>(1) Kohler agrees to obtain pre-approval from as many regulatory bodies (IRS, State Accounting Boards, Bar Associations, etc…) as possible for as many classes and trainings in the MSTP© Program in the accounting, legal, and financial industries. However, Kohler does not ‘guarantee’ that any particular class will qualify as Continuing Education credit for a Member’s particular license.<p><p>(2) Nonetheless, Kohler will provide any Member upon request the information typically necessary to apply on their own behalf with a regulatory body to receive approval for a class or training, before or after the Member takes a class online or in person. This information would include the class learning objectives, outline, PowerPoint slides, quizzes, surveys, and any other information reasonably available to Kohler.<p>K. Refunds<p>(1) A full refund of the Purchase Price of the MSTP© Program can be obtained within 7 days from the date of purchase. After the initial 7-day period, a graduated refund system applies for the next 23 days.<p><p>(2) The “Graduated Refund System” is a refund based on the fact the Member had the opportunity to watch, learn, and be involved with the training for a period of time (whether or not the Member took advantage of the opportunity before requesting a refund). Thus, the refund amount decreases each day after the Member’s purchase by a fixed amount calculated as follows: (The total Purchase Amount divided by 23 = the refund amount reduction per day after the 7 day right of recission period).<p><p>(3) To initiate a refund request, Members must contact our Member Support Team in writing and request said refund. No reason is required during this 30-day period.<p><p>(4) Upon approval, refunds will be processed by our Member Support Team within 1 to 3 business days. Funds will be returned to the Member's account used to purchase MSTP© Program typically within 10 to 14 business days.<p><p>Example 1.1 – If the purchase price is $9,995, each day after the initial 7-day period, the potential refund amount decreases by approximately $434.57 ($9,995/23). A refund request on day 20, would result in a refund of $977.60. ($9,995 – (20 days x $434.57) = $1,303.60.<p>L. MSTP© 3x3 Money Back Guarantee<p>(1) The MSTP© “3x3 Money Back Guarantee” is the promise made by Mark J. Kohler that a Member should reasonably obtain new clients from the MSTP Network© within 3 months of being listed on the Network, and the total annual advisory fees of those new clients will be greater than 3x the Purchase Price paid by the Member for the MSTP© Program, or their money paid for the Program shall be fully refundable.<p><p>(2) In order for a MSCTA© to qualify for and receive the refund, the Member must complete the following:<p><p>be Certified under the program in the current year, or the Member has maintained their Certification by Re-Certifying for the current year if necessary, AND be currently paying for the MSTP© Monthly Membership Training and not past due, AND completed and have continued to maintain the Member Marketing Standards regularly distributed and set-forth for the Members on the Resource Page of the MSTP© Membership Site, AND been Certified for at least 3 months.
